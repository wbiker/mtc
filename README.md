Muris Trainings Plan Creator

This is, or rather, will be, the webside for Muris Trainings Plan Creator. 
Its purpose is to provide the ability to create, edit or delete trainings plans for customers.

The backend is Catalyst and at the moment a SQLite database. Should SQLite to simple for this purpose I will change to postgresql. But at the moment for simplicity I will stay with sqlite.
